<font size= "3">Until today a citizen had to go to Police station in person to report a crime and anonymous events like thefts, murder and other events. 
The process of resolving the case involved a lot of manual work. As we know manual work is error prone. This application we are building is an online crime
reporting system to improve the communication between police and public which will help improve time utilization in solving crime and much time wasted to communicate with police.
We will be able to increase problem solving efficiency in time period using this application. The proposed system applies to all Police Institutions across 
the country and specifically looks in to Crime record management.There is a prominent requirement of highly responsive Information management system as a backbone to manage and retrieve data at a high speed.
